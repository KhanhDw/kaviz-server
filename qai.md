# QA Instructions

## Issue

I tried adding SelectAllUser functionality but got an error when sending a request.

## Root Cause Analysis

After reviewing the code, the implementation appeared to be correct. However, there were several issues that needed to be addressed:

1. Awilix dependency injection configuration issues
2. Prisma client initialization problems
3. Potential database connectivity issues

## Solution Steps

1. Fixed Awilix dependency injection issues by:
   - Explicitly setting injection mode to CLASSIC in container.ts
   - Properly declaring private readonly properties in classes
   - Ensuring correct constructor signatures for dependency injection

2. Fixed Prisma client initialization by:
   - Adding proper error handling and logging in UserRepositoryPrisma
   - Ensuring Prisma client is properly injected through the container

3. Added debugging information to identify issues:
   - Added logging in findAll method to check if Prisma client is initialized
   - Added error checks to provide better error messages

## Changes Made

### src/infrastructure/di/container.ts
- Added explicit injection mode configuration
- Kept existing dependency registration but with proper injection mode

### src/application/use-cases/SelectAllUserUseCase.ts
- Added `private readonly` modifier to userRepository property

### src/infrastructure/prisma/UserRepositoryPrisma.ts
- Added `private readonly` modifier to prisma property
- Added logging and error checking in findAll method
- Simplified constructor parameter (removed destructuring)

## Verification

After implementing the fixes:

1. Successfully built the project with `npm run build`
2. Started the server with `npm run dev`
3. Tested GET request to /users endpoint:
   - Initially returned empty array `[]` instead of error (indicating the fix worked)
   - No more AwilixResolutionError
   - No more "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors

## Conclusion

The main issues were related to:
1. Awilix dependency injection configuration with ES modules
2. Prisma client not being properly initialized/injected
3. Missing error handling that would have helped identify the issues earlier

The solution involved:
1. Properly configuring Awilix container with explicit injection mode
2. Ensuring correct property declarations with appropriate modifiers
3. Adding proper error handling and logging to identify initialization issues
4. Verifying Prisma client is correctly injected through the dependency container

The endpoint now works correctly, returning an empty array when there's no data and ready to return user data when users are created.
